4) df's class is a "SparkDataFrame", while df1's class is a "data frame".\\~\\
5b) There is an error message: "Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable) :  unable to find an inherited method for function ‘select’ for signature ‘"data.". This is probably because of the difference in the classes of each data frame.\\~\\
6b) The same thing happens as in the previous exercise. 
 
\section{Question 7}
I would like to automatize downloading several links available at the same page. I don't know if this is actually considered scrapping, but I have heard of it as such and I needed it when I was downloading the data for my research. So, for example, I had to download the .csv file for all the crimes registered in a certain month of a certain year. However, I wanted it for every month of several years, which made me click on every single file. The same thing happened for some other files I had to download for another research project. It took me a week to download all the files I wanted for the crimes, not to mention the tedious job of waiting and clicking. That's why I wanted to learn how to do it.
