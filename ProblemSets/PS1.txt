\section{Question 5}
I am a PhD student in Economics, in the second semester of the third year. 
I am interested specially in the Development field an also starting to work with some themes related to Labor. 
For the first field, I am currently working on a paper that is investigating the effects of better public lighting on crimes. 
For the second one, I want to see the effects of Venezuelans migration into Roraima State in Brazil on native wages. \\~\\
So, my biggest plan for this class is to increase my skill set on programming, one of the most important skills for economist nowadays (in my opinion). 
It was really hard to learn ``stata" on my own when I started the program, so I know the value of someone teaching you this kind of programming. 
I still do not know what I will do for this class as a final project. 
I am still familiarizing myself with all this new language and I still have some things to catch up, but I'm sure I will figure it out pretty soon. \\~\\
My plan after graduation is being a professor and a researcher in some university in the U.S. 
I have always been interested in being a professor and in writing. 
Thus the PhD program combined these two wishes and presented me what I want to do in the future.
